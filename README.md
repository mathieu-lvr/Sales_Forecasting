# Sales Forecasting for a bar

Based on a study made on Walmart Company we worked on predicting the sales of a pub. Our goal was
to first find the features that influenced the consumption of beers in the pub and then to be able to predict
the number of sales. By testing a lot of algorithms we found out that Random forest was the best way to
predict. The result of our work is a table with the number of beer the user will sale for each week.
